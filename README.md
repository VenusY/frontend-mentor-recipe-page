## Why I Built This Project

I built this project as part of a personal challenge to build more projects with React in order to become more comfortable with the library as it is one that's widely used in the tech industry.

I also wanted to gain more experience with HTML tables and lists as I haven't had much opportunity to use them prior to this challenge. It was interesting learning these new topics, and I'm looking forward to utilising them more in the future.
